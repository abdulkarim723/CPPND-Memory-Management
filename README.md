# CPPND: Memory Management Chatbot

This is the project for the third course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Memory Management. The starter code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot). The Chatbot is already working but with not much interest of memory management and the use of advanced features of C++ 11 and later such as move semantics and smart pointers. In this project more attention was given to memory management and these advanced features.
